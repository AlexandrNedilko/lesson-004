/*"6. Create a class and demonstrate proper encapsulation techniques
        the class will be called Printer
        It will simulate a real Computer printer
        It should have fields for toner level, number of pages printed, and also
        whether its a duplex printer (capable of printing on both sides of the paper).
        Add methods to fill up the toner (up to a maximum of 100%), another method to
        simulate printing a page(which should increase the number of pages printed).
        Decide on the scope, whether to use constructors, and anything else you think is needed."
        //========================================================================================//
        Tips
        "Example of fields:
private String manufacturer;
private String model;
private boolean isColor;
private String type;
private boolean isDuplex;
private int tonerLevelBlack;
private int tonerLevelMagenta;
private int tonerLevelYellow;
private int tonerLevelBlue;
private int printedPages;
Example of methods:
fillUp(int tonerVolume, String color);
print(int pages, String color, boolean isDuplex);
tonerIsEmpty();
getTonerLevel(String toner);
etc."
